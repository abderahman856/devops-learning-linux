Objective

To set up a functional Linux environment for DevOps development and verify system connectivity.

Environment Details

Platform: Killercoda (Ubuntu 24.04 LTS)

Shell: Bash

Verification Commands

I used the following commands to verify my environment:

# Check system information
uname -a

# Verify current user
whoami

# Check current directory
pwd


Discovery

I learned that uname -a provides the kernel version and system architecture, which is vital when troubleshooting compatibility issues in DevOps.
