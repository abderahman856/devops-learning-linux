Steps that i took to complete my first script;

- Creating empty file using 'touch' command.
  
- went in to the file to edit using 'vim' command.

- added 'shebang line' (it will cover coming lessons) at the first line of my file to tell the linux to run in the bash.

- Then writing a message or script that i wanted to exacute later using "echo" comnad.

- saved file and quit to the terminal.

- Then since i wanted to exacute the script i gave an exacute permission using 'chmod' command.
  
- Lastly, typed './file's name' to see the script worked. 🚀
