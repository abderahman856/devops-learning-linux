Bash Scripting Mastery 🚀

Welcome to my Bash Scripting repository. This project contains a collection of scripts developed to master Linux automation, system administration, and shell programming.

📂 Project Structure

The project is organized into four main sections:

bash-scripting/assignment/: Contains the core challenge scripts submitted for evaluation.

bash-scripting/Bash_arena/: A sandbox environment for testing complex logic and experimental scripts.

bash-scripting/lessons/: Documentation and notes from the learning phase of the course.

bash-scripting/quizzes/: Results and practice sets from progress assessments.

🛠️ Assignment Challenges

Inside the assignment folder, you will find the following automation tools:

1. Basic Arithmetic Calculator (calculator.sh)

An interactive script that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Key Feature: Implements a safety check to handle and prevent division by zero errors.

2. File Operations Automator (bash_demo.sh)

A script that automates the creation of workspace environments.

Functionality: Creates a directory, generates a timestamped text file, and verifies the content immediately.

3. Permission & Existence Checker (file_checker.sh)

A DevOps tool used to verify file integrity and security settings.

Functionality: Checks if a file exists and provides a visual report (✓/✗) on Read, Write, and Execute permissions.

4. Smart Backup Utility (backup_script.sh)

A backup automation tool that organizes files into timestamped archives.

Functionality: Collects all .txt files from a source directory, moves them to a uniquely named folder, and provides a final file count report.

5. Bonus: System Monitor (system_monitor.sh)

A high-level system administration script for health checks.

Metrics Captured: CPU Load, Memory Usage (Total/Used/Free), Disk Space, and a list of the Top 5 memory-consuming processes.

Output: Generates a timestamped .log file for historical tracking.
