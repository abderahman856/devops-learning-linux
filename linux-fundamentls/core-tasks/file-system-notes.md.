Objective

Practice navigating the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) and managing files.


Commands & Examples

cd /var/log: Moved to the system log directory to inspect server messages.

ls -lah: Listed all files, including hidden ones, in a human-readable format (showing sizes in KB/MB).

mkdir -p projects/demo: Created a nested directory structure in one command.

touch test.txt: Created an empty file for testing purposes.

cp test.txt projects/demo/backup.txt: Copied and renamed a file to a different directory.


Discovery

Using ls -lah is much more useful than a standard ls because it shows file sizes and hidden configuration files 
(dotfiles) that are often used in DevOps tools like Git and Docker.
